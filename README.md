The Smart Helmet is an IoT-based safety system that includes accident detection, emergency alerts, and real-time tracking. It connects to a custom mobile app via Bluetooth, allowing the rider to save emergency contact numbers.

Accident detection relies on three main conditions:

- Sudden speed drop
- Tilt detection using a gyroscope
- Impact detection with a 3-axis accelerometer

If all these conditions are met, the helmet automatically calls and sends SMS alerts with the live accident location to the saved emergency contacts. Before sending the alerts, it provides an audio warning. This gives the rider a chance to cancel false alerts using a physical button.

Through the mobile app, parents or guardians at home can track the rider’s live location and current speed at any time. This ensures quick accident response and ongoing monitoring for safety and peace of mind.
